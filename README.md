## 📂 Project List  

| #  | Project Name               | Description |
|----|----------------------------|-------------|
|‎  ‎ 1️⃣ |[Check If a Number is Prime](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Check%20If%20a%20Number%20is%20Prime)|Checks if a number is prime by verifying it has no divisors other than 1 and itself|
|‎  ‎ 2️⃣ |[Check if a Number is Even or Odd](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Check%20if%20a%20Number%20is%20Even%20or%20Odd)|The program checks if the input number (`num`) is even by using the modulus operator|
|‎‎‎  ‎ 3️⃣ |[Check if a String is a Palindrome](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Check%20if%20a%20String%20is%20a%20Palindrome)|This Swift program checks whether a given string is a palindrome|
|‎  ‎ 4️⃣ |[Detect if a Number is Prime](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Detect%20if%20a%20Number%20is%20Prime)|A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself|
|‎  ‎ 5️⃣ |[Fibonacci Series](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Fibonacci%20Series)|The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers|
|‎  ‎ 6️⃣ |[Find GCD](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Find%20GCD)|This Swift program calculates the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two integers using **Euclid's algorithm**|
|‎  ‎ 7️⃣ |[Find the Factorial of a Number](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Find%20the%20Factorial%20of%20a%20Number)|This Swift program calculates the **factorial** of a given number `n` recursively|
|‎  ‎ 8️⃣ |[Find the Largest of Three Numbers](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Find%20the%20Largest%20of%20Three%20Numbers)|The program uses the `max` function to compare the values and find the largest|
|‎  ‎ 9️⃣ |[Find the Most Frequent Element in an Array](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/tree/main/Swift%20Projects/Find%20the%20Most%20Frequent%20Element%20in%20an%20Array)|The program uses the `reduce(into:)` method to count the occurrences of each element and then identifies the element with the highest frequency|

## 📦 La Installation

### 𓀃 The Actual Installation🤌🤌

#### You can use [Programiz Complier](https://www.programiz.com/swift/online-compiler/) or similar online compliers to run the code

#### But if you're using e.g. Windows Powershell you should:

- Make sure you have GO installed. You can install it using [GO](https://go.dev/doc/install):

  ```
  go version
  ```
  
- [Download](https://github.com/JakubStachh/GO-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the code
- Unpack the zip file
- Find the `GO-Projects-main\GO Projects\`
- Open the folder of the program You want to try out `GO-Projects-main\GO Projects\Anagram Check`
- and then run:
  
  ```sh
  go run AnagramCheck.go
  ```
#### Should work in `Visual Studio Code` if yours *had been already set up for Golang*

# THANK YOU!
```python
1. And Voilà! You've done it! You've actually checked my code! 
2. Thank You. All I'm hoping for is... that I hadn't make any mistakes.
3. Well... maybe... rather: that they're not THAT serious.....
4. If there are any: I'm sorry, and I will update it when the right time comes....
