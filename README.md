## üì¶ La Installation

### ìÄÉ The Actual Installationü§åü§å

#### You can use [Programiz Complier](https://www.programiz.com/swift/online-compiler/) or similar online compliers to run the code

#### But if you're using e.g. Windows Powershell you should:

- Make sure you have Swift installed. You can install it using [Swift](https://www.swift.org/install/):

  ```
  swift --version
  ```
  
- [Download](https://github.com/JakubStachh/Swift-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the code
- Unpack the zip file
- Find the `Swift-Projects-main\Swift Projects`
- Open the folder of the program You want to try out `Swift-Projects-main\Swift Projects\Check if a Number is Even or Odd`
- and then run:
  
  ```
  swiftc CheckifaNumberisEvenorOdd.swift -o CheckifEvenOrOdd.exe
  ```
- and then:
  ```
  ./CheckifEvenOrOdd.exe
  ```
#### Should work in `Visual Studio Code` if yours *had been already set up for Golang*

# THANK YOU!
```python
1. And Voil√†! You've done it! You've actually checked my code! 
2. Thank You. All I'm hoping for is... that I hadn't make any mistakes.
3. Well... maybe... rather: that they're not THAT serious.....
4. If there are any: I'm sorry, and I will update it when the right time comes....
